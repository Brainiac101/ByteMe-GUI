# ByteMe-GUI

A GUI modification of the ByteMe application.

Added GUI for homepage, login, register, student and admin menus, viewing pending orders, and viewing list of all items.

Most of the functionality is still in CLI, only displays and menu option checking is added into the GUI

All assumptions of the previous submission hold

## Serialization

Added serialization, that is file handling, for saving customer data, item menu, and each user's orders.

## JUnit

Added tests:
- Customer login (invalid username/password and leaving empty fields)
- Out of stock item ordered
